 * Live state of the voice loop, published on `window.__voice`.
 *
 * When someone says the wake word and nothing happens there are only a handful
 * of possible causes — the recogniser never started, it started and died, it is
 * running but hearing silence, or it is hearing you and transcribing the name
 * as something else. From outside the page those are indistinguishable, which
 * makes the failure impossible to report and impossible to fix. This tells them
 * apart in one glance.
