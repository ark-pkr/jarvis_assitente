 * MCP policy, and why it is shaped this way.
 *
 * A short list of "servers that can change things" is the wrong default,
 * because it is a list of what we happened to think of. Every server not on it
 * runs unconditionally — and on a real machine that quietly includes placing a
 * phone call, spending an advertising budget, deleting a generated character
 * and writing files to disk. A voice assistant cannot ask "are you sure", so
 * the bridge has to be the one that is sure.
 *
 * So the default is deny, softened in two ways so the demo stays usable:
 *
 *   1. READ_ONLY_MCP is an explicit allowlist of servers whose whole surface is
 *      lookups and generation — search, registries, analytics reads. Anything
 *      there runs in read-only mode.
 *   2. Everywhere else, the tool has to argue for itself: its own name must
 *      begin with a read verb. `list_devices` runs; `install_apk` does not.
 *
 * On top of both sits a veto: a name containing a plainly effectful verb needs
 * ALLOW_WRITES no matter which server it came from, which is what keeps
 * `make_outbound_call` and `download_lottie` still until you ask for them.
